 1  The flow of a request starts as a new thread creating an instance of
    BaseHTTPRequestHandler to handle it.

    ====
    [HTTP Request] -> (start.py)BaseHTTPRequestHandler
    ====
    
    The BaseHTTPRequestHandler will then parse the request.  For anything but 
    a request to a .py file it will open the file with the same name based 
    in the web_content directory.  i.e
    
    ====
    GET /index.html
    
    will get read the contents of ./web_content/index.html.
    
    GET /images/back.png
    
    will send the back.png image from ./web_content/images/back.png
    ====
    
    If a .py file is requested it will be split into two phases.  The controller
    will handle the request and a pyhtml file within the web_content directory will
    render it.  i.e
    
    ====
    GET /hello_world.py
    
    First the controller located in ./web_content/hello_world.py will be run.  Then
    all declared variables from the controller will be available in the view rendered
    from ./web_content/hello_world.pyhtml
    
    [hello_world.py] = """
    message = "hello world"
    """
    
    [hello_world.pyhtml] = """
    <html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
     <h1> <%= message %> </h1>
    </body>
    </html>
    """
    ====

    examples:
    
       1 <% for i in range(10): %>
       2    <%= i %>*<%= i %> : <b> <%= i*i %> </b>
       3 <% end %>
       4 <h3>done</h3>
       
       
       1 <% os %>
       2 Current Directory <%= os.getcwd() %>
