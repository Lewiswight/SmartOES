A single thread (./libs/http_helper.py) CWMControl will be responsible in handling interactions
with the Connectware exist database.  It will contain a list of gateways/channels that it will
continuely iterate through, putting values in a table.  It will only do this while requests are
coming in, if requests stop for approx 12 seconds the thread will pause execution until another
request comes in.

When a request for the data on a particular channel occurs, the request thread will pull from the
table the most recently read value.
