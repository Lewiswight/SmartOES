Data needs a path from the sensor to the collector.  That&rsquo;s the role of the local network.  The local network may be wired (Serial / Ethernet) or it may be wireless (Zigbee, Wi-Fi). Given the evolution to emerging wireless local networks, it&rsquo;s likely that a customer&rsquo;s actual local network will be a combination of both wired and wireless technologies.  All accomplish the same &#45; a reliable path to the gateway.  <br><br>
This demo employs ZigBee (802.15.4) low-power wireless. Digi&rsquo;s ZigBee components can coordinate their sleep cycles to extend battery-powered deployments to years, thus going wherever the remote asset goes. Digi&rsquo;s ZigBee implementation is power&amp;play. Wireless nodes self-discover each other and their route to a coordinator.
