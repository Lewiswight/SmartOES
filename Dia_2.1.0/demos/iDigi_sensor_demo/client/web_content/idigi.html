<p class="slide_content">
iDigi&reg; Messaging & iDigi&reg; Storage services  enable application and device information interaction.  They broker the application messaging and data exchange, simplifying the development and management effort. In this demo, a DIA-based application uses the Messaging service to push sensor data to the Storage service. The browser-based application (representing an enterprise application) then retrieves sensor data from the Storage service in order to populate the dashboard widgets.
