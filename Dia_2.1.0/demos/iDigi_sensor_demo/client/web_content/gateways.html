<p class="slide_content">
Business processing starts at the edge. Gateways aggregate and route collected sensor data. The Digi gateway is also the home of Remote-IQ.  Digi's embedded Python engine hosts the Digi Device Integration Application Framework (DIA), a Python foundation I/O library.  DIA is what makes data collection easy-to-implement and efficient.  The Dia provides "channels" for each I/O device (sensor). The developer simply has to select a driver for the channel (serial, Ethernet, ZigBee, etc.), presentation (protocol) and then initialize the Dia engine.  User-focused code refers to the Dia channels for I/O.
