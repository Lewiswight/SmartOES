The Digi gateways  look for a transport path to the next stop in the application, typically over a wide-area-network (WAN). WANs may be private or public, IP-based or not, terrestrial or wireless (cellular). In this demonstration, the WAN bridges the Digi gateway (ConnectPort X4) and the Digi solution enablement platform (Connectware&reg; Messaging & Connectaware&reg; Storage). Digi's device management platform, Connectware&reg; Manager, is often used to ensure that the gateways are optimized for the WAN link(s) required to transport sensor data to the customer application.
