Data collection starts here.  The sensor provides a current state for its measurement responsibility and makes it available to a gateway / aggregator via various physical interfaces including Analog, Digital, Serial, Ethernet or various wireless technologies (ZigBee, Wi-Fi, etc.)<br><br>
This demo utilizes Digi&rsquo;s XBee Light/Temperature/Humidity sensor to illustrate the end-to-end capabilities of sensor to collection to device and information management.<br><br>
The Digi Device Integration Application Framework (DIA) enables the developer/integrator to add additional devices quickly and easily.  Adding a new device is as easy as including the new device&rsquo;s parameters in the DIA configuration file.  DIA then creates a new channel for the device, which the Gateway Python user code simply calls for reading data.
