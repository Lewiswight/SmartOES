iDigi&reg; Messaging & iDigi&reg; Storage services  enable application and device information interaction. They may be hosted by the customer or by Digi (ASP). They broker the application messaging and data exchange, simplifying the development and management effort. Industry-standard, Web Services-based, these Connectware&reg solution enablers bring the power and flexibility of advanced application architectures to the device networking ecosystem.<br><br>In this demo, a Python-powered application on the ConnectPort X4 gateway uses the Messaging service to push sensor data to the Storage service. The browser-based application (this PC) then retrieves sensor data from the Storage service for further use.
