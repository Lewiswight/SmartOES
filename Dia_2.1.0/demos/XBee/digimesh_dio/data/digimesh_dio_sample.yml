    # XBee drivers can be used with both DigiMesh and ZigBee network managers.
    # 
    # But there a few differences:
    # * The sleep settings specified in the XBee driver are ignored
    #   when the DigiMesh manager is used, because the DigiMesh
    #   manager's sleep_time and wake_time are used instead.
    # 
    # * The sample rate only applies while the device is awake.
    #
    # In this configuration, the DIO will send 30 samples a minute (once per second
    # during the awake period and none during the sleep period).
