    Base class that any device driver must derive from.

    The :class:`DeviceBase` class is extended in order to create new
    Dia device drivers. :class:`DeviceBase` defines several properties
    and methods for use in iDigi Dia devices including a name for the
    device, a set of property channels that can be populated with
    information about the device as well as the methods for
    interacting with those channels, and virtual *start* and *stop*
    methods that must be implemented in each driver.

    Parameters:

    * *name*: the name of the device
    * *settings*: configures device settings. Used to initialize
      :class:`~settings.settings_base.SettingsBase`
    * *core_services*: The system
